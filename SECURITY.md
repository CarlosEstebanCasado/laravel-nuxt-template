## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- Or use GitHub Security Advisories if enabled for the repository

We will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours** and provide a remediation plan or status update as soon as possible.
